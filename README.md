# OverSpeeding-Detector (Project #2)
This is a python based project which calculates the speed of a vehicle according to distance entered.
This software is developed in python and can we easily set-up on any Raspberry Pi model. It uses motion detection and records the times at which an object enters and leaves the frame. A time graph is also plotted for every object that enters the frame. It is specially designed for highways (straight roads with limited flow of traffic) where Over Speeding is a Menace. It can be easily used by police in our country.
